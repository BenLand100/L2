# L2

This is a python version of the [L language](https://github.com/benland100/L) 
with a few changes to function naming schemes. Like L, L2 is an interpreted
LISP-like language, with an emphasis on having a very simple interpreter in the
host lanugage (Python), with most language functionality implemented in L2 
itself. 

L2 aims to be a software implementation of a machine, or hardware, that is
capable of executing L2 code directly. This project aims to explore simple 
Turing-complete machines that strike a balance of "easy to program" (as seen
in non Neumann machines) and "simple to build" (as seen in Rule 110 
automatons), which are competing criteria in programmable machines.
